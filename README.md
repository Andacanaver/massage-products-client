<h1>Massage Therapy Products</h1>

This is the start of an app that could be used in a Massage Therapists' website. It has the ability to have many products and descriptions of them. Along with the ability for a user to register an account and login to save products for future use. In the future I would like to polish it up even more and add many more things to it.
